# Simple Addition Example
# This program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations
# Result: AC = 10 + 5 = 15

# Load constant 10 into accumulator
LOCO 10

# Store it at memory address 100
STOD 100

# Load constant 5 into accumulator
LOCO 5

# Add the value at address 100 to accumulator
# AC = 5 + 10 = 15
ADDD 100

# Store result at address 101
STOD 101
